# Heart Failure Survival Analysis

Analyze heart failure data using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazard models. We explore stratified models with considerations for lead time bias.

## Dataset

We use a dataset from the UCI Learning Repository containing 13 clinical features. Our event of interest is death.
